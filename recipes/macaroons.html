            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Stir together coconut, flour, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in sweetened condensed milk and vanilla using your hands until well blended.</li>
